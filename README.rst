What is this mess?  Let's do 100 days of cleanup... However, there are some ground rules.
No more than 15 minutes can be spent each day.  No removal of core functionality.

- Day 1 (1/1/2021).  Removed some conditional compilation.
- Day 2 (1/2/2021).  Removed PyFloat_AS_DOUBLE macro.  
- Day 3 (1/3/2021).  Removed PyLong_AS_LONG, PyType_FastSubclass, PyType_Check, PyType_CheckExact macros.
- Day 4 (1/4/2021).  Removed PyList_GET_SIZE and PyList_GET_ITEM.
- Day 5 (1/5/2021).  Removed PyTuple_GET_SIZE and PyTuple_GET_ITEM.
- Day 6 (1/6/2021).  Removed PySequence_Fast_GET_{SIZE,ITEM}. PySet_GET_SIZE. PyDict_GET_SIZE.
- Day 7 (1/7/2021).  No progress.
- Day 8 (1/8/2021).  No progress.
- Day 9 (1/9/2021).  Some list API cleanup.
- Day 10 (1/10/2021). PyTuple_SET_ITEM -> PyTuple_InitItem

What is this new line of modifications you ask?  At this point, it's
about restoring data abstraction layers.  No direct access to
data. Removal of macros and performance hacks.
